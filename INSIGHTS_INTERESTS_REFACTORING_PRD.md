## üìä Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ **RESOLVED Issues:**
- **Interest Duplication:** Eliminated duplicate Interest enums
- **Inconsistent Categories:** Standardized to 8 unified categories
- **Compilation Errors:** Fixed button style and type issues

### üîÑ **Remaining Issues:**

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Specifications

### ‚úÖ **Unified Interest Enum (Complete)**
```swift
enum Interest: String, CaseIterable, Codable {
    case love = "Love & Relationships"
    case career = "Career & Work"
    case mood = "Mood & Energy" 
    case finance = "Money & Finance"
    case future = "Future Insights"
    case spiritual = "Spirituality & Growth"
    case relations = "Relationships"
    case situations = "Life Situations"
}
```

### üîÑ **New Architecture (Pending - Phase 2)**
```swift
// To be created:
@Reducer struct Insights { }
struct InsightsView: View { }
```
